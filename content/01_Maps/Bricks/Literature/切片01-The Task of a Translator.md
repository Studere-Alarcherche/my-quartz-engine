# The Task of a Translator

I had arrived then at the conclusion that we are not free in the presence of the work of art to create it as we please, but that we have to discover it in ourselves as though it were a natural law (which must at once impose a check upon any "experimental" art). But this discovery, which art creates, is it not, was it not—I had still to ask myself—also the discovery of what ought on the contrary to be most precious to us, and what usually remains for ever unknown to us, **our true life, reality as we have felt it to be**, which differs so much from what we think it is that we are so filled with delight when chance brings us a genuine memory of it? I felt this to be so, and yet, assured as I was of the truth of this vague idea, my head was still so heavy that I did not yet understand it.

The book whose characters are figured, not by us, but by our lives, is the only book that is really ours. The essential, the only true book, though in the ordinary sense of the word it does not have to be "invented" by a great writer—for it exists already in each one of us—has to be translated by him. **The duty and the task of a writer are those of a translator.**

## The Material of Literature

Now, though I understood that this was indeed the nature of the work of art, I had still to understand clearly from what source that work derived its materials. And I saw that, although the materials of the work of literature are provided by the past life of the writer, they are not provided by it immediately, or rather, the writer must not merely copy them from his memory, but has to recreate them.

For, as I was saying just now, the slightest word that we have said, the most insignificant action that we have performed, at any epoch of our life, was surrounded by, and coloured by the reflection of, things which logically had no connexion with it and which have been separated from it by the intellect which could make nothing of them for its own rational purposes, simplifications and social necessities: **the pink reflection of the evening on the flower-covered wall of a country restaurant, a feeling of hunger, the desire for women, the pleasure of luxury; or again, the blue volutes of the morning sea, wrapped in spirals round the strains of music which only partly emerge from it, like a mermaid's shoulders; the candour or the indifference of the waiter, the swindler's face of the banker, the purity of the sky, the warmth of the sun, the presence of the woman we love**; all these things, which were present at the moment when the action was performed or the word uttered, and which have been eliminated by the workings of our intellect or our voluntary memory, were nevertheless the things that gave the action or the word its specific reality, its only truth.

And it is arguably the writer's task to recover this reality, to bring back these things which the intellect has discarded, to rescue this reality which we have lost, and to restore it to us in the work of art.

## The Seed and the Signs

And so I was already coming to the conclusion that the task of the writer is to rediscover the reality that has been lost, to re-create the "true life," the life that is, in a sense, outside time, and that this task is identical with the task of the translator, for the "essential book" is the only one that is true, the only one that matters. And suddenly I thought of that other book, the book of my own life, which I had just seen to be identical with this "essential book" of which I had caught a glimpse, and I realized that the materials of my work were my own past life; I understood that all those materials of my literary work were my own past life; I understood that I had acquired them in the midst of frivolous amusements, in idleness, in tenderness and in pain, stored up by me without my divining their destination or even their survival, **just as the seed stores up all the ingredients which will nourish the plant**. Like the seed, I could die when the plant had developed, and I found that I had lived for it without knowing it, without ever having realized that my life was to be the material of a work of art.

And realizing that, I realized also that I must not flinch from the suffering which the realization of this work would entail. For if the work of art is a translation, a deciphering of the signs that are embedded in us, the reading of these signs is a painful act. The truths which the intelligence grasps directly and openly in the full light of day have something less profound, less necessary about them than those which life has communicated to us in spite of ourselves in an impression which is material because it has entered us through the senses but whose spirit we can extract.

In short, in this case as in the other, whether it be a question of impressions like the one I had received from the sight of the steeples of Martinville, or from the uneven paving-stones in the courtyard of the Guermantes mansion, the task was to interpret the given sensations as signs of so many laws and ideas, by trying to think—that is to say, **to draw forth from the shadow**—what I had merely felt, by trying to convert it into its spiritual equivalent. And this method, which seemed to me the only one, what was it but to create a work of art?
