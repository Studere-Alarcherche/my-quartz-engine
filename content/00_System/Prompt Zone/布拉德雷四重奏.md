## 🏁 Phase I: Initiation / Reconnaissance

User input:

```
Start: [Keyword]
```

System actions:

- Define **Core Tension (Anchor)**: the main conflict/tension of the concept or term

## ⬇️ Phase II: Essay Node (Logical Deep Dive)

User input:

```
Ready: Essay
```

System actions:

- Output **Essay task card**
    

### Essay Task Card Example

- 📖 Reference: Book title + Author
    
- 📍 Location: Chapter / Page
    
- 🗝️ Reading Keys (3–5 critical questions):
    
    1. What are the core logical questions or assumptions?
        
    2. How does the author trace conceptual evolution?
        
    3. What are the key reasoning steps?
        
    4. Which parts of the text trigger deeper thinking?
        
    5. How could you evaluate the author’s conclusions?
        

**Abstract:**

- A brief overview of the logical chain of the concept for quick assessment

## ⬇️ Phase III: Story Node (Narrative Deep Dive)

User input:

```
Ready: Story
```

System actions:

- Output **Story task card**
    

### Story Task Card Example

- 📖 Reference: Book title + Author
    
- 📍 Location: Chapter / Page
    
- 🗝️ Reading Keys (3–5 critical questions):
    
    1. Where are the narrative turning points or fractures?
        
    2. How is the concept embodied in the story?
        
    3. What real-world consequences of the concept does the story explore?
        
    4. How does the plot map cognitive or social practice?
        
    5. What sensory or symbolic triggers appear in the story?
        

**Abstract:**

- Brief summary of the narrative and the conceptual simulation

## ⬇️ Phase IV: Network & Resonance

User input:

```
Connect
```

System actions:

- **Cross-Temporal Correspondences**
    
    - Conceptual evolution: Classical → Renaissance / Enlightenment → Modern
        
    - Recurrent themes and practices: rituals, spaces, institutions
        
    - Conceptual echoes across texts and authors
        
- **Structural Observations**
    
    - Concept operates as a network of practices rather than a single ideology
        
    - Tension patterns recur but never fully harmonize
        
    - Iterative motifs: agency, public dissent, deliberative spaces

## ⬇️ Phase V: Recursion & Synthesis

User input:

```
Connect: Synthesis
```

System actions:

- **Future / Contextual Transformation**
    
    - Temporal Operation 1 (historical/theoretical): challenge default assumptions → new interpretation
        
    - Temporal Operation 2 (modern/real-world): test concept’s contemporary function and limitations
        
- **Integrative Questions (3–5)**
    
    1. How does semantic tension reflect institutional or conceptual instability?
        
    2. Which two or more sensory or imagery triggers enhance understanding?
        
    3. How do narrative or argumentative structures map cognition and practice?
        
    4. Which patterns persist or transform across time?
        
    5. How might the concept evolve in future contexts or face limitations?

✅ **Key Features**

1. **Strict node cycle**: Poem → Essay → Story → Connect
    
2. **Each node outputs task card + abstract**, not full text
    
3. **Step-down halt mechanism** ensures user confirmation before moving on
    
4. **Phase III / IV advanced analysis preserved** for cross-textual and cross-temporal synthesis
    
5. **Fully replaceable** Keyword and references for autonomous use

I can also create a **full example run** with a real Keyword and book references, so you can immediately test the Poem → Essay → Story cycle with task cards and abstracts.

Do you want me to generate that example now?
